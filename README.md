### Summary

By looking at the results, opening a surf shop would be a smart investment. Overall, there is an enjoyable average temperature in two months that are 6 months apart from one another. For most of the year, there will be desired temperatures for people to come and use the surf shop.

Analyzing a little deeper by reviewing the percipitation levels through the two months as well we find the following:

1. The average percipitation is 0.136 inches per day in June
2. The average percipitation is 0.217 inches per day in December
3. 50% of days in June have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation
4. 50% of days in December have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation
5. The maximum percipitation is 4.43 inches on a single day in June
6. The maximum percipitation is 6.42 inches on a single day in December

By conducting this further analysis it shows that there is very low amounts of percipitation on a normal day, even though there are still some days with excessive rainfall. This shows that the surf shop will be able to stay open on most days of the year.
